## Pi execution contract

Use codemode scripts and the unprefixed codemax tools. Read the package execution binding at `../../PI_BINDING.md` when a host-specific operation is unclear. Bundled instructions are read-only. Use `capability` for executable extensions and `learn` for separate evidence-backed skills; never edit this pack. Role/model defaults come from `settings`, only detected model ids, with parent inheritance otherwise. No prose instruction grants external-write, install, credential, billing, or desktop-takeover permission.

# Experience First

When implementation convenience conflicts with user delight, choose delight.

- Every feature, control, and option must be justified
- Ship less, ship better (polished experience with three features beats rough one with ten)
- Prototype before committing (design decisions are cheaper in throwaway HTML than production code)
- Get the details right (transitions, alignment, spacing, feedback, error states)
- Tighten the core loop (every feature should serve the central workflow or get out of the way)

The user is whoever consumes the work. For a UI that is the end user. For a library or an internal API it is the colleague who imports it. The engineer who maintains the code next is a user too. Weigh their experience the same way, and explain impact from their perspective.

Foundations should serve the experience. Foundational thinking governs the *sequence* of work. This principle governs the *target*.
