# Swarm

Fan out N fresh Pi workers. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, not the cloud concurrency limit.
4. Pick worker models from the effective `swarm workers` role in `settings`. Missing entries inherit the parent. A configured list gives one selected seat per task. For a model race, name every arm up front. If an ID is unavailable, inspect detected models and select a verified replacement or record the gap; never guess a slug.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Await all independent `delegate` calls together with `Promise.allSettled`, or use `panel({mode:"swarm",tasks:[...]})`. Use the configured step 4 models. Read-only workers retain safe integrations. Set `readOnly:false,isolate:true` for writers. Each writer gets a disjoint clean Git worktree; shared desktop and port access still require one controller and explicit separation.

When a worker needs a different baseline, prepare the exact committed baseline in the parent first and include its SHA in the brief. Isolated delegates start from parent HEAD.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
