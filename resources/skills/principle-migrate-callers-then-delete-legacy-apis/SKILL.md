## Pi execution contract

Use codemode scripts and the unprefixed codemax tools. Read the package execution binding at `../../PI_BINDING.md` when a host-specific operation is unclear. Bundled instructions are read-only. Use `capability` for executable extensions and `learn` for separate evidence-backed skills; never edit this pack. Role/model defaults come from `settings`, only detected model ids, with parent inheritance otherwise. No prose instruction grants external-write, install, credential, billing, or desktop-takeover permission.

# Migrate Callers Then Delete Legacy APIs

When we decide a new API is the right design, migrate callers and remove the old API in the same refactor wave instead of preserving compatibility layers.

**Rule:**
- Do not keep legacy API paths only because internal callers still exist
- Inventory callers, migrate them, and delete the old API immediately
- Treat temporary adapters as exceptional and time-boxed, not default architecture
- Update tests to assert the new contract, and delete tests that only protect pre-refactor implementation details

**When this applies:**
- No external users depend on backward compatibility
- The project can absorb coordinated breaking changes
- The new API is part of a simplification or refactor initiative

Keeping both old and new APIs creates dual-path complexity, slows cleanup, and makes the codebase feel append-only.
