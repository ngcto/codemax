## Pi execution contract

Use codemode scripts and the unprefixed codemax tools. Read the package execution binding at `../../PI_BINDING.md` when a host-specific operation is unclear. Bundled instructions are read-only. Use `capability` for executable extensions and `learn` for separate evidence-backed skills; never edit this pack. Role/model defaults come from `settings`, only detected model ids, with parent inheritance otherwise. No prose instruction grants external-write, install, credential, billing, or desktop-takeover permission.

# Outcome-Oriented Execution

Optimize for the intended, verifiable end state rather than preserving smooth intermediate states.

**Why:** Keeping every intermediate step fully stable often creates temporary compatibility code that becomes long-lived debt. Converge on the target architecture and prove correctness at explicit verification boundaries.

**Core rule:**
- Prioritize end-state integrity over transitional stability
- Intermediate breakage is acceptable when it is planned, scoped, and reversible

**Guardrails:**
- Use this for planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries
- Declare where temporary breakage is acceptable
- Keep high-signal checks for actively touched areas while migrating
- Require full static and runtime verification at plan completion
